The model was initialized in half-precision (16 bit float instead of 32 bit float) to fit into GPU memory. The average length of text generated by the model was 230 words. The energy consumption got measured with <a href=\"https://github.com/lfwa/carbontracker/\" target=\"_blank\">CarbonTracker</a>, a tool developed by researchers from University of Copenhagen.<br><br>As a result, one request to GPT-J consumed in average <b>0.01292 kWh</b>.",
