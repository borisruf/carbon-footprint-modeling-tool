  "description": "In the absence of reliable data on the energy consumption of GPT-4o, this information is extrapolated from the most optimistic estimation made for GPT-4. We don't have any official information on the number of parameters of GPT-4o, so we can make a guess based on the price of tokens processing for both models. However, you need a <a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/PLf7tvzujaJ2A2r7N/what-the-cost-difference-in-processing-input-vs-output\" target=\"blank\">lot more memory/memory bandwidth to process an output token than an input token</a>, because to process an output token you also need to fit the KV cache in memory. This known, we'll make our estimations based on the price of output tokens.	The <a href=\"https://openai.com/api/pricing/\" target=\"blank\">price</a> of 1 milion output token of gpt-4-turbo is $30, whereas for gpt-4o it is $10.<br/><br/>Therefore, we assume that submitting a query to GPT-4o requires <b><a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=10/30\" target=\"blank\">3x</a> less</b> energy than for GPT-4.",
