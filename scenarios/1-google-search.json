  "description": "Google published energy and carbon emission data in 2009 related to a traditional Google search on their blog. According to Google, a single search produces approximately 0.2 grams of CO2, which is comparable to the emissions from a small load of laundry. The energy consumed per search is roughly 0.0003 kWh, or 1 kJ. This estimate accounts for the energy efficiency of Google's data centers and the minimal energy needed to process user queries.",
