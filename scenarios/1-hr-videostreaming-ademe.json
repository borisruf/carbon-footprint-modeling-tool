The <a href='https://base-empreinte.ademe.fr' target='_blank'>ADEME database</a> is often cited as the source (although it no longer includes this value), as is a study by <a href='https://negaoctet.org' target='_blank'>NÃ©gaOctet</a> (which can no longer be found on the Internet).<br/><br/>This figure should be treated with caution as it does not consider key factors in the calculation of emissions from this activity, such as the energy grid and the end-user device.",
