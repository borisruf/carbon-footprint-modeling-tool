The calculation and the underlying assumptions he made are further illustrated in this <a href='https://github.com/borisruf/carbon-footprint-modeling-tool' target='_blank'>carbon footprint scenario</a>.<br/><br/>In January 2023, ChatGPT had about 100M unique users who made <a href='https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/02/chatgpt-100-million-users-open-ai-fastest-growing-app' target='_blank'>590M</a> queries to GPT-3.
